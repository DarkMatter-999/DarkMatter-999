### Hey there! 👋

I’m **Lakshyajeet** (aka **DarkMatter-999**), a software engineer from India.

I build fast, reliable systems from **low-level graphics engines** to **production-grade web platforms**.

I enjoy solving hard problems, writing clean code, and shipping things that actually get used 🚀.

### What I work with 🛠️

I don’t chase tools, I use what gets the job done.

**Backend & Systems**
- Python, PHP, C, Go, Rust, C++  
- REST APIs, CLI tools, media pipelines, automation  

**Web & Platforms**
- WordPress (Themes, Plugins, Gutenberg, FSE, WP-CLI)  
- React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS  

**Databases & Infra**
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- Docker, AWS, Linux, Git  

**Graphics & Low-level**
- Vulkan, OpenGL, CUDA

### A few things about me 🌿

- I like **low-level graphics** and **high-level web systems**
- I enjoy building tools more than using them
- I’m equally happy debugging Vulkan validation layers or WordPress queries
- I care about **clean architecture**, **performance**, and **developer experience**
- I keep plants around, good code grows better in a green environment 🌱
